## Step 1: ☢️ Attack Model

In order to secure a system, one should be aware of the 
__capabilities__ of the attackers, this is more important than trying
to consider all the possible specific attacks/exploits that can be
performed on the system. Once you have a detailed list of the 
capabilities of an attacker you can proceed to restrict these 
capabilities, this list of capabilities is the systems 
__Attack Model__. 

Likewise if an attacker is trying to exploit the system they should 
be aware of the attack model (their capabilities) and take advantage
of the capabilities that are unrestricted.
